# Stereoscopic vision and emotional face processing
We combined immersive Virtual Reality (VR) technology with EEG measurements to investigate the recognition and neurophysiological responses to digital humans' emotional facial expressions (neutral, happy, angry, surprise) - contrasting stereoscopic and monoscopic viewing conditions. The git repository provides the code to analyse the EEG and behavioral data of the study.
